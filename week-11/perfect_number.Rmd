In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

```{r include=FALSE}
x<- 5
check_if_perfect_number <- function(x) {
  divisors <- c()
  for (i in 1:(x-1)) {
    if (x%%i==0) {
      divisors <- c(divisors, i)
    }
  }
  if (sum(divisors)==x) {
    return(T)
  }else{
    return(F)
  }
}




```


```{r}

for (j in 2:10000) {
 if (check_if_perfect_number(j)) {
   print(paste0('A perfect number is: ', j))
 } 
}

```
