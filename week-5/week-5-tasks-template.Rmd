## Dplyr tasks

Load the `nycflights13` package and **write code**, to reproduce the same result that showed here while you answer the questions!

```{r, message=FALSE}

# comment multiple lines 
# ctrl + shift + c

# Clear environment
rm(list=ls())

# install.packages('nycflights13')
library(nycflights13)
library( tidyverse )

```

```{r}
# df %>%
#   filter() %>% 
#   group_by()%>%
#   summarise( ) %>%
#   arrange()%>%
#   head()
